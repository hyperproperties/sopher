Runtime verification of Probabilistic time-sensitive hypercontracts defined using hyper hoare logic in Go.

> To show contracts can be extended to hyperproperties using hyper hoare logic reasoning over sets of executions. With FISSC as motivation we will show how to express hyperproperties in contracts to show how hyperproperties can help us capture violations of contracts for programs which can undergo bit flips.
